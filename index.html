    <p>
      A blockchain is a type of
      <mark> distributed ledger technology (DLT) </mark> that consists of
      growing list of records, called blocks, that are securely linked together
      using cryptography. <sup>[1][2][3][4] </sup> Each block contains a
      cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction
      data (generally represented as a Merkle tree, where data nodes are
      represented by leaves). The timestamp proves that the transaction data
      existed when the block was created. Since each block contains information
      about the previous block, they effectively form a chain (compare linked
      list data structure), with each additional block linking to the ones
      before it. Consequently, blockchain transactions are irreversible in that,
      once they are recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered
      retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks.

    <h2>History</h2>

    <hr />
    <p>
      Cryptographer David Chaum first proposed a blockchain-like protocol in his
      1982 dissertation "Computer Systems Established, Maintained, and Trusted
      by Mutually Suspicious Groups."[11] Further work on a cryptographically
      secured chain of blocks was described in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W. Scott
      Stornetta.[4][12] They wanted to implement a system wherein document
      timestamps could not be tampered with. In 1992, Haber, Stornetta, and Dave
      Bayer incorporated Merkle trees into the design, which improved its
      efficiency by allowing several document certificates to be collected into
      one block.[4][13] Under their company Surety, their document certificate
      hashes have been published in The New York Times every week since
      1995.[14]
